# Exhaustive licensing information for files in the LuaSTGPlus repository
# =========================================================================
#
# This file aims at documenting the copyright and license for every source
# file in the LuaSTGPlus repository, and especially outline the files
# whose license differs from the MIT/Expat license used by LuaSTGPlus.
#
# It is written as a machine-readable format following the debian/copyright
# specification. Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect
# all corresponding files (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those
# with a more explicit copyright statement.
#
# Licenses are given with their debian/copyright short name (or SPDX identifier
# if no standard short name exists) and are all included in plain text at the
# end of this file (in alphabetical order).
#
# Disclaimer for thirdparty libraries:
# ------------------------------------
#
# Since thirdparty libraries are all downloaded during the building phase,
# licensing details for thirdparty libraries are given in a special form.
# For example:
#   Files: ./*/_deps/fmt-src/
# is indicating the licensing information about the 'fmt' library.
# Considering the licensing *may* change in the future, only the "main" license
# at the time we are importing these libraries is described in this statement.
# It's user's responsibility for checking whether the licensing of thirdparty
# libraries meets your requirements or not.

 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
 Public License
 .
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
 bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
 License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract,
 You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
 these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
 consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed
 Material available under these terms and conditions.
 .
 Section 1 â€“ Definitions.
 .
 a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
 that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
 Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
 modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar
 Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the
 Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
 Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed
 relation with a moving image.
 b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar
 Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms
 and conditions of this Public License.
 c. BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
 creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as
 essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
 d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
 related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
 sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
 rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the
 rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
 e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
 of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations
 under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,
 and/or similar international agreements.
 f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
 exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your
 use of the Licensed Material.
 g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a
 Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License
 are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.
 h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
 material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
 i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
 conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
 Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
 Licensor has authority to license.
 j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
 Public License.
 k. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
 commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
 License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to
 Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is
 NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in
 connection with the exchange.
 l. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
 requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
 display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
 importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways
 that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
 individually chosen by them.
 m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
 from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded,
 as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
 this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 â€“ Scope.
 .
 a. License grant.
 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
 irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
 to:
 A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
 NonCommercial purposes only; and
 B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
 only.
 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
 and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You
 do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
 You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
 or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so.
 The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
 forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
 Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent
 Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
 making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
 Material.
 5. Downstream recipients.
 A. Offer from the Licensor â€“ Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
 Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
 exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public
 License.
 B. Additional offer from the Licensor â€“ Adapted Material. Every recipient of
 Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
 exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of
 the Adapter's License You apply.
 C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
 different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
 Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
 construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of
 the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
 official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution
 as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
 b. Other rights.
 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
 Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
 rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
 to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
 to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
 from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through
 a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
 licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
 to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other
 than for NonCommercial purposes.
 .
 Section 3 â€“ License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
 a. Attribution.
 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
 A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
 Material:
 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
 designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
 Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
 ii. a copyright notice;
 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
 practicable;
 B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of
 any previous modifications; and
 C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
 include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
 based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
 Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
 providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
 information.
 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
 required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
 .
 b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
 Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the
 same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible
 License.
 2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
 License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner
 based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions
 on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that
 restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 â€“ Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
 Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
 extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
 contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
 database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
 which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
 is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
 substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
 Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
 other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 â€“ Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
 a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
 possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
 and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
 Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes,
 without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
 particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects,
 accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
 discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in
 part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
 b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
 any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
 any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
 or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public
 License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised
 of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a
 limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may
 not apply to You.
 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
 shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
 approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 â€“ Term and Termination.
 .
 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
 Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
 then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
 6(a), it reinstates:
 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
 within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
 Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
 Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed
 Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public
 License.
 d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 â€“ Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
 conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
 Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
 conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 â€“ Interpretation.
 .
 a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
 interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of
 the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
 this Public License.
 b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
 unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
 necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
 shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
 enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
 c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
 to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
 d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
 limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
 Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
 authority.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
   The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
   some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
   various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
   FreeType Project.
 .
   This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
   which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
   affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
   documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
   This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
   (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
   and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
   alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
     o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
       interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
     o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
       full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
     o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
       it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
       somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
       FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
   We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
   software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
   We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
   assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .
   Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
   credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
   encourage you to use the following text:
 .
    """
     Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType
     Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
    """
 .
   Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
   actually use.

 .
   Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
   and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
   distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
   Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
   beta or final release.
 .
   `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
   `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
   code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
   This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
   engine'.
 .
   This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
   FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
   documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
   original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
   If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
   this license, you must contact us to verify this.
